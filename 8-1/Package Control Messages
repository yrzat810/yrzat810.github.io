CSS3
----

  VERSION 1.3.2 CHANGES
  
  1) The url() rule now only highlights quoted URLs. Unquoted URLs are not
     illegal in CSS, but they are discouraged by the spec as legacy code. Unquoted
     URLs have to be specially parsed, have more characters that need to be
     escaped, and do not support URL modifiers. Please update your code.
  
         https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#urls
  
  2) Fixed translate*() rule not matching percentages.

  VERSION 1.3.0 CHANGES
  
  1) full SVG2 support
  2) HTML5.1 element selectors
  3) update for latest Media Queries Level 4 draft
  4) update for CSSOM View Model spec
  
  This is a big update! There are lots of new highlighting rules and completions.
  If you see anything that looks wrong, please open an issue here:
  
  	https://github.com/y0ssar1an/CSS3/issues
  
  Thanks very much!

  VERSION 1.2.16 CHANGES
  
  1) Support user-select, since it's now on the standards track.
  2) Update for the latest changes to the CSS Basic User Interface Module
     Level 4 spec.
  3) The install notes describe how to disable Emmet CSS completions
     by adding these lines to the Emmet package settings:
  
  		"show_css_completions": false,
  		"disable_tab_abbreviations_for_scopes": "source.css"
  
     Thank you mohamadnorouzi20 for pointing this out!

  VERSION 1.2.11 CHANGES
  
  1) Removed the "Insert Reset" and "Insert normalize.css" features
  
      These were being inserted in minified form. I've been persuaded
      that writing your source in minified form is a bad idea. They
      were out of date anyway.
  
  2) Dropped the beta tag from the Validate call, since no issues have
     been reported.
  
  3) Updated for recent changes to the CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1
     and CSS Template Layout Module specs
  
  4) Support for these new Scroll Snap Points Module Level 1 properties.
  
      scroll-snap-coordinate
      scroll-snap-destination
      scroll-snap-points-x
      scroll-snap-points-y
      scroll-snap-type
  
     These are usable with the -ms- prefix, or unprefixed in Firefox 39
     with the layout.css.scroll-snap.enabled flag.
  
  Lastly, if your favorite CSS property isn't being highlighted properly,
  or is missing a completion, please report it here:
